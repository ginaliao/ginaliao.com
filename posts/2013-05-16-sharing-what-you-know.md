For the longest time I’ve wanted to start a blog about my experiences in web development. But I’ve always had this fear of putting myself out there which has led to a whole lot of procrastination on my part. It’s scary writing about processes and sharing code snippets when there are so many talented folks out there who know their stuff.

It’s important to share what you know, as you never know who may learn from it. Over time, knowledge becomes second nature and you forget that these are learned best practices through experience. Something you might think is obvious could be an “A-ha!” moment for someone else.

If anything, this will be a journal of sorts and I know I’ll be coming back to re-read my blog in a few years’ time and look back at how far I’ve come.

Stay tuned!
