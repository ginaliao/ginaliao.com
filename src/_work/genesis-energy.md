Genesis Energy is New Zealand's largest electricity and gas retailer. Seeing the success of their [sister company's new sign-up forms](/work/energy-online), we were tasked with overhauling their existing forms with the same framework. This also included creating ad hoc forms often requiring bespoke functionality such as a usage calculator component or multi-page experience which I had to plan and implement.

I was also responsible for the front-end development (using HTML, Sass and jQuery), ensuring a seamless device-agnostic experience as well as parts of the back-end development (using PHP), which included Zendesk integration.
