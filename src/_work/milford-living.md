To support NZRPG's upcoming luxury apartment complex, Milford Living, we were tasked with creating a website that would enable users to find more about the development and its progress updates.

In order for the website to stand out from other competitors' cookie-cutter templates, each element was considered to create a luxury interactive experience. The result was quite an unconventional approach. The home page showcases their introduction video with a custom viewing experience enabled by utilising the Videojs plugin; on desktop, the video is only partially visible, encouraging the user to interact and explore. Each page is loaded via AJAX, with a sleek transition between each page. One of the key requirements was for the content to be easily updatable by non-technical staff; with the integration of Advanced Custom Fields, we were able to develop a flexible system of layout options.
