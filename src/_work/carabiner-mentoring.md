Carabiner Mentoring is a non-profit organisation that pairs disabled youngsters with a mentor. They required an online presence where both mentors and mentees could easily apply to become a part of the program.

With a rock-solid mix of WordPress, Gravity Forms and custom post types, adding media and other content for non-technical folks was a cinch.
