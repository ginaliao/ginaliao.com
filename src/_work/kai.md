Kai is an up-and-coming meal planning and grocery delivery service that aims to dramatically reduce food waste and accelerate healthy, sustainable food to all people. I was contracted to build their marketing website in WordPress as well as build the CSS for the web app.

The most challenging aspect of architecting the CSS for the app was identifying similarities in components and making them as reusable as possible. As the site utilised a considerable amount of SVG icons, these were organised by automating a build process for creating SVG symbol spritesheets that could then be referenced with fragment identifiers.
