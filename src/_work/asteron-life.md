Asteron Life is an award-winning life insurance company all about celebrating life. They required a tool that would enable users to print out a list of relevant questions they could take to their adviser based on their answers to a short questionnaire. The tool had to be fully responsive and feel interactive and personalised to the user.

I was tasked with translating our lead designer's design into a module that could be dropped into their Drupal platform. This involved building a small JavaScript application for determining and outputting the results ready for print. Special care was made to use semantic form elements when building the UI components to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
