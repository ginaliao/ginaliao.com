Energy Online is an award-winning power company based in New Zealand. Their multi-page sign-up forms had experienced significant bounce rates. After the success of the landing page created for their multi-media campaign which introduced a responsive one-page form (developed by our team), we were tasked with a complete overhaul of their customer sign-up forms.

I was responsible for the front-end development (using HTML, Sass and jQuery), ensuring a seamless device-agnostic experience as well as parts of the back-end development (using PHP), which included Zendesk integration.
