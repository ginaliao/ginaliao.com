New Zealand Retail Property Group was in the process of an evolution from retail property management to creating town centres and needed a revamp to the design and functionality of their array of websites, starting with Milford Living and their corporate website.

For their corporate website, my responsibility was to build a fully responsive WordPress Multisite website, ensuring the content could be easily updated by non-technical staff. One of the challenges was to create a blog system that would display posts with a different layout depending on whether it was a short news item or a standard post; I developed custom pagination in order to display up to two short news items and up to six standard posts on each page. Performance was optimised by minimising the use of off-the-shelf WordPress plugins and running all assets through a Grunt build task via continuous deployment.
