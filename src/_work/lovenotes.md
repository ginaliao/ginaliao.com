Lovenotes is a service all about creating beautiful stationery out of scrap paper. They had no brand identity or web presence. They required a website that was visually appealing and could convey information in a clear, concise fashion. It was also imperative that they would be able to easily edit content themselves.

Given a formula for how many sheets of paper were required to create each item of stationery, I also developed a tool for calculating how many products can be created from a user-specified amount of paper and selection of products.
