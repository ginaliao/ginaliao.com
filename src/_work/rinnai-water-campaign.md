Rinnai is renowned in the gas hot water market, but there is less electric hot water brand recognition. They wanted to not only transition the consumer into thinking of Rinnai for water heating, but increase rapport with installers. To support the campaign, we were tasked with building a microsite where homeowners could find out how much they can save on their power bills and go into a draw to win their hot water solution.

My responsibilities included building a fully responsive landing page from a supplied design; translating an existing offline table-based calculator into an interactive tool which was built using jQuery and Handlebars; API integration to a third-party email marketing platform using PHP; and building a series of animated HTML5 banners to support the campaign.
