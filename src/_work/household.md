HouseHold is a new cleaning service on the market that is all about ethics and using eco-friendly products. We were tasked with creating an online presence for them with an extremely tight deadline (only a week for design and development).

I was responsible for the front-end development (using HTML, Sass and jQuery). We wanted to keep the website light and performant for the user, so I chose to use Jekyll to create a static website. Due to the nature of static websites, I integrated the forms on the site with a combination of Google Forms and Google Sheets.
