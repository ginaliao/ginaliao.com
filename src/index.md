I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a fancy degree in graphic design. While I didn't need formal training to get into the industry, I believe a passion for what you do and an eagerness to learn will get you far.

It's my philosophy to always strive to be better than yesterday, and I enjoy finding opportunities to incorporate new techniques into projects where possible. Find out more about my [skills and toolset]({{ "/process" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
