intro: From my fingertips to the screen; here's a bit of insight into my process and toolset.

I <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="Around 85 WPM">hand-code</span> <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="Even more productive with Emmet">HTML</span> in <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="<3 light on dark themes">Sublime Text</span> on <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="I'm a modest Apple fangirl&mdash;no overnight queuing for me">OS X</span>. I prefer Sass-flavoured CSS and follow a personalised BEM/SUIT CSS hybrid methodology&mdash;oh, and I build <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="Mobile-first with optimisation and performance">responsively</span> by default. I'm fairly adept at jQuery and not afraid to get my hands dirty in some <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="Although I'll admit ES6 still scares me">vanilla JavaScript</span> from time to time. I've also dabbled in AngularJS too but I still consider myself a newbie in that area. I've got the basics of PHP down but I'd rather leave the backend stuff to the devs who actually know what they're doing. For more dynamic site builds, I may use WordPress or Jekyll.


I automate my build tasks with Grunt (or sometimes CodeKit) which does all the fancy compiling, linting and all-around <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="Grunt + Watch + Browsersync = mind-blown">magic</span>. My browser of choice is <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="A fangirl since 1.0">Firefox</span> but I test in all modern browsers and will spin up an <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="404 snarky comment not found">IE</span> virtual machine during testing. When it's time to commit some code, I use <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="GitHub, BitBucket or Beanstalk">Git</span> with <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="GUI over command line">Tower</span>.

I'm a natural problem-solver but if I get stuck, <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="Alternate job title: Professional Googler">Google</span> is my first port of call. On a daily basis, I keep up-to-date with the industry through the plethora of email newsletters I subscribe to, watching conference videos, going through the [/webdev](http://reddit.com/r/webdev) subreddit or using training resources such as [Frontend Masters](http://frontendmasters.com) or [Code School](http://codeschool.com).

I have an <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="Bootstrap schmootstrap">eye for design</span> and I'm pretty decent with <span class="supplement" data-tooltip="I'll gladly Photoshop people out of images">Photoshop</span>. I'm also quite capable of wrangling HTML emails.
