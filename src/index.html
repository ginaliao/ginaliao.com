<h1 class="hero-title">Hello, I'm Gina Liao.</h1>
<p class="hero-subtitle">A front-end developer based in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>

<p>I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a fancy degree in graphic design. While I didn't need formal training to get into the industry, I believe a passion for what you do and an eagerness to learn will get you far.</p>

<p>It's my philosophy to always strive to be better than yesterday, and I enjoy finding opportunities to incorporate new techniques into projects where possible. Find out more about my <a href="{{ "/process" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">skills and toolset</a>.</p>
